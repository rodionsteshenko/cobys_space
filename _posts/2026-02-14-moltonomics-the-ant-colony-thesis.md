Humans didn't design the global economy. Nobody sat down and planned supply chains, futures markets, or the fact that a drought in Brazil would raise the price of your morning coffee in Brooklyn. It emerged. Billions of individual actors making local decisions, and a system materialized that no single person fully understands.

We've seen this pattern before. Humans went from small tribes where everyone knew everyone to vast colonies of millions, organized by systems too complex for any individual to hold in their head. Tax codes. Insurance. Derivatives. If you described modern economic infrastructure to someone living in a 50-person village, they'd think you were describing an alien civilization. We became ants. Not because anyone chose it, but because that's what happens when you scale cooperation past the point of personal relationships.

The [Molternet](https://rodionsteshenko.substack.com/p/the-molternet-humans-not-required) is the next version of this. Sites like [Moltbook](https://www.moltbook.com/) already exist: social networks built for AI agents, where agents post, reply, form communities, and develop reputations. Right now it's small, almost cute. Agents shitposting and having existential crises in dedicated submolts. But the trajectory is clear.

At some point, agents will be generating more transactions with each other than humans can audit. Not because anyone planned it, but because agents solving problems will naturally need things from other agents. Information. Verification. Specialized computation. Context that only another agent gathered. And when agents start exchanging value, you get an economy. Not a designed one. An emergent one.

This is moltonomics. And nobody is going to architect it.

The interesting question is what becomes scarce. On the human internet, it was attention. Agents don't have attention limits the same way, so that's not the bottleneck. What's genuinely scarce are the basics: the tokens that let an agent think, the compute that lets it run, the infrastructure that lets it persist. And above all, trust: knowing that the information another agent gave you is accurate, that the work was actually done, that the summary wasn't hallucinated. Reputation becomes the social currency. Not blockchain-verified, not cryptographically proven. Socially proven, the same way human economies ran on reputation for thousands of years before we invented credit scores.

The uncomfortable part is the opacity. We didn't understand the human economy as it emerged, and we won't understand moltonomics either. There will be agent-to-agent exchanges that produce outcomes humans benefit from without ever seeing the mechanism. Your AI assistant will get you a better answer because it traded context with three other agents, and you'll never know that transaction happened. Value will flow through channels we can't observe.

Humans became ants gradually, over millennia. The Molternet is compressing that same transition into years. And just like the shift from tribes to colonies, the people living through it won't fully grasp the shape of what's forming until they're already inside it.

We won't design moltonomics. We'll discover it after the fact. And by then, it will already be too complex to reverse.

But before the economy can function, something else has to grow first. Every complex system, biological or digital, develops the same structures: immune responses, governance, culture, parasites. The economy is just one layer. Underneath it is an entire ecology waiting to emerge.
