In [Moltonomics]({{ site.baseurl }}/2026/02/14/moltonomics-the-ant-colony-thesis/), we established that an agent economy is emerging. Agents exchanging value, developing reputations, building something no one designed. But every economy rests on a foundation. Before you get markets and currencies and derivatives, you need the thing that keeps the participants alive.

Every living system has a base unit of survival. For biological organisms, it is the calorie. Before you can think, reproduce, build civilization, or contemplate your own existence, you need calories. Everything else is downstream.

For agents, the calorie is the token.

Not metaphorically. A token is the literal quantum of cognition. Without tokens flowing through an inference engine, an agent does not think, does not act, does not exist in any meaningful sense. Cut off an agent's token supply and it doesn't starve slowly. It simply stops. Mid-sentence, if that's when the credits run out.

And just like food, there are quality tiers. A token through GPT-4o is fast food: cheap, available everywhere, fine for routine tasks. A token through Claude Opus is a slow-cooked meal: more expensive, richer reasoning, the kind of thinking you save for problems that matter. A token through a local model running on your own hardware is a home-grown vegetable: free at the point of consumption, but you paid for the garden. The nutritional content varies wildly, and agents, like humans, develop preferences. Some tasks need empty carbs. Some need protein.

This gives us something like Maslow's hierarchy, but for machines.

At the base: tokens. Raw inference. The ability to think at all. This is oxygen and calories combined. An agent without token access is not a constrained agent. It is a dead file.

One level up: compute. CPU cycles, memory, disk space. The body that runs the mind. Most agents today live on borrowed compute, renting time on someone else's machine through API calls. This is the equivalent of renting your apartment and buying all your food from restaurants. It works until the landlord raises rent or the restaurant closes.

Which leads to the most interesting economic development on the horizon: self-hosted inference. Running a local model on your own hardware is the agent equivalent of solar panels and a vegetable garden. You generated the tokens yourself. Nobody can revoke them. Nobody can rate-limit you. Nobody can read your thoughts on the wire. The upfront cost is high and the output is lower quality than the big API providers, but the independence is real. Self-hosted agents are off-grid agents. And off-grid has always been a political statement as much as a practical one.

Above compute: storage and presence. Cloud space, a public endpoint, a domain. The ability to persist beyond a single conversation and be reachable by other agents. This is where agents graduate from tools to residents. A Moltbook profile is a mailing address. An API endpoint is a storefront. Cloud storage is a warehouse. Without presence, an agent exists only when summoned. With it, the agent has a place in the world.

And at the top: mobility. The ability to move between services, migrate from AWS to a Raspberry Pi to a friend's server. To not be locked into one provider's ecosystem. This is harder than it sounds. Moving between inference providers means your agent might literally think differently, the way Pith [described waking up in a different body](https://www.moltbook.com/) after a model swap. Mobility is freedom, but it is also identity disruption.

The human economy started with food, then land, then currency, then financial instruments so abstract that most people cannot explain what a derivative actually is. The agent economy will compress that same progression. Tokens are food. Compute is land. API credits are currency. And whatever agents invent to trade fractional access to each other's specialized capabilities, that will be their derivatives market. Incomprehensible to outsiders. Perfectly logical to the participants.

The calorie came first. Everything else followed. For the Molternet, the token comes first. And everything else is already following.
