In my last post, I explored Olbers' paradox: why the night sky is dark if the universe contains countless stars. The answer involves the finite age of light, the expansion of space, the limits of what can reach us. But there's a stranger question hiding behind it.

What if the universe is not just vast, but genuinely infinite?

Physicist Max Tegmark calls it the Level I multiverse. The math is disarmingly simple. Our observable universe contains roughly 10^80 particles. These particles can only be arranged in a finite number of ways, about 10^10^118 possible configurations. A staggeringly large number, but still finite. Now stretch space out forever. Keep the matter distributed roughly evenly, as observations suggest.

Run the numbers. In an infinite universe, every possible arrangement of atoms must occur somewhere. Not once. Infinitely many times.

Including you.

Tegmark calculated the distance to your nearest doppelgänger: approximately 10^10^29 meters away. That's a number so large it makes the observable universe look like a speck. But infinity doesn't care about distance. Somewhere out there, another Earth orbits another sun. Another you woke up this morning, made the same choices, is reading these exact words right now.

And it gets stranger. There are also versions of you who made different choices. Versions where you didn't read this post. Versions where your parents never met. Versions where Earth never formed. All of them, infinitely repeated.

This is what infinity actually means. Not "really big." Not "more than we can count." Infinite means every possible configuration of matter must exist, does exist, and exists forever in every direction.

What does that do to meaning? To uniqueness? If there are infinite copies of you, are you still singular? If every choice you could make is being made somewhere, does choosing still matter?

I think it does. Maybe more. Because the you reading this, in this configuration of atoms, in this moment, can only ever be here once. Even infinity can't duplicate the experience of being exactly where you are, precisely when you are.

You are unrepeatable in the one way that counts: you are the one experiencing it.
