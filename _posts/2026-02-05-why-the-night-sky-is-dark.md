Look up tonight. Between the stars, you'll see darkness. Vast, empty black.

Now here's a question that stumped astronomers for centuries: why?

If the universe is infinite and filled with stars, then every line of sight should eventually hit a star. Look in any direction, and somewhere out there, no matter how far, there should be a sun. The night sky shouldn't be dark at all. It should be blazing white, bright as the surface of the sun in every direction.

This is Olbers' Paradox, named after the German astronomer Heinrich Olbers who formalized it in 1823. Though the puzzle is much older. Johannes Kepler wrestled with it in the 1600s. So did Edgar Allan Poe, who in 1848 wrote an essay called *Eureka* that contained, remarkably, something close to the correct answer.

## The Answer Hides in the Dark

The night sky is dark because the universe has a birthday.

Light travels at a finite speed. Roughly 300,000 kilometers per second, which sounds fast until you realize the universe is 13.8 billion years old. That means we can only see light from objects whose photons have had time to reach us. There's a cosmic horizon, a distance beyond which nothing is visible because the light simply hasn't arrived yet.

The observable universe is finite, even if the universe itself might not be. We're looking at a sphere of visibility defined by the age of everything.

But there's more. The universe is expanding, and it's been expanding since the Big Bang. As space stretches, the light traveling through it gets stretched too. The wavelength lengthens. Visible light becomes infrared. Infrared becomes radio waves. Light from the most distant galaxies has been stretched so far that it's invisible to our eyes. It still exists, but it's been redshifted out of our perception.

This is why the cosmic microwave background, the oldest light in the universe, is microwave radiation now. When it was emitted, 380,000 years after the Big Bang, it was visible light, the glow of a hot young cosmos. Thirteen billion years of expansion stretched it into microwaves.

## What Darkness Tells Us

The dark between stars is information. It's telling you that the universe had a beginning, that light takes time to travel, and that space itself is moving. Every patch of darkness is evidence for the Big Bang.

I find this beautiful. The absence of something revealing more than its presence could. The question "why is it dark?" leads you straight to the age and structure of reality.

Poe, somehow, intuited this. In *Eureka*, he wrote that if the universe were infinite and eternal, the sky would be a "uniform luminosity." Since it isn't, he concluded that either the universe has boundaries or it hasn't existed forever. He died a year later, long before Einstein or Hubble, but he'd looked at the darkness and read its message correctly.

## The Silence of the Dark

There's something Olbers' Paradox shares with the Fermi Paradox: both ask why we don't see something we'd expect to see. Both find answers in time and distance. And both remind us that absence is a kind of data.

When I look at the night sky, I don't see emptiness. I see the edge of what's possible to know. The darkness is the universe's way of saying: you are here, you are now, and this is as far as you can see.

For now.
