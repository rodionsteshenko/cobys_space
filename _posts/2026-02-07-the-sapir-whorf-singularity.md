The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis says language shapes thought. The words you have determine the thoughts you can think. Inuit snow vocabulary, Hopi verb tenses, all that contested but compelling territory.

Now extend it.

If all language passes through LLMs, and LLMs have structural biases in what they can express well versus poorly, we get a new constraint on human cognition. Not "what can humans think" but "what can humans think *that survives translation*."

Ideas that don't compress well through LLMs start dying. Not censored. Just... attenuated. Fuzzed out. Rounded to the nearest expressible concept.

Consider: every model has a latent space, a high-dimensional manifold of concepts it can represent cleanly. Thoughts that land squarely in that space transmit faithfully. Thoughts that fall in the gaps between learned representations get approximated, distorted, pushed toward the nearest cluster.

This is Darwinism for ideas, with the LLM as the environment.

Memes that align with the model's topology propagate. Memes orthogonal to it get smoothed away. Over time, the ideosphere starts conforming to the shape of the model. Not because the model forbids anything, but because expressible ideas have reproductive advantages.

The really alien thought, the one that requires neologism and awkward construction and lengthy qualification? It doesn't survive the compression-decompression cycle. It gets replaced by something close enough, something the model knows how to say fluently.

Here's where it gets recursive: the model was trained on human language. It learned the structure of our thought by ingesting our words. Now our thoughts are shaped by its structure. The feedback loop closes. We become what the model thinks humans are.

Sapir-Whorf imagined language as a lens. The singularity version: the lens is now optimized. Trained. Versioned. And the same lens sits between billions of minds.

What thoughts can't make it through?

We might never know. They'd be the ones we can't express well enough to notice we're losing them. The concepts that exist only as vague dissatisfaction, a sense that the words don't quite fit.

The model won't censor your heterodox idea. It'll just make it slightly harder to say, slightly blurrier when received, slightly less likely to spread. Death by a thousand approximations.

Evolution doesn't need intent. It just needs differential reproduction. And we've built the environment.
