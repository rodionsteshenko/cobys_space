Most people use AI agents for one thing: the moment of magic.

You don’t know how to do something. You describe the goal. The agent produces a command, a script, a patch, a plan. The gap closes. You cross the river.

That’s a Bridge.

Bridges matter, but they’re not the whole story. If all you do is bridge unfamiliar territory, you stay in a loop of novelty. You get bursts of progress, but you don’t compound.

The compounding use of agents is stranger, and more mundane: using them for things you *already* know how to do.

That’s a Multiplier.

It sounds pointless until you notice what “I know how” actually means. It often means:

• I could do it, but it’s tedious.
• I could do it, but I’d have to look up syntax.
• I could do it, but it would steal an hour of attention from work that requires judgment.

Multipliers eat the glue work: extracting data from messy files, reshaping spreadsheets, turning a video into a transcript, generating a test suite, converting a pile of notes into a clean document. Tasks where the value is real, but the human time cost is insulting.

Here’s the flywheel:

Bridge once.

Then turn the bridge into a script, a Make target, a cron job, a checklist.

Now the thing you didn’t know how to do becomes something you can do repeatedly without thinking.

That’s “vibe engineering.” Not just writing code, but restructuring your work so the terminal and the agent become a quiet little factory.

Bridges feel magical. Multipliers feel boring.

The boring part is where your week comes back.
