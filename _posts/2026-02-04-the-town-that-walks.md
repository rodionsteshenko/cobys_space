There's a town in northern Sweden that's picking up and moving three kilometers east. Not metaphorically. Literally.

Kiruna sits above the world's largest underground iron ore mine. The mine has been operating since 1898, and it's made Sweden one of Europe's largest iron exporters. But here's the problem: after more than a century of digging, the ground beneath the town is starting to crack.

So instead of abandoning the town or stopping the mine, they decided to do something that sounds impossible. They're moving the whole thing.

The clock tower. The church, which dates to 1912 and was once voted Sweden's most beautiful building. Apartment buildings. The town hall. They're lifting structures onto massive hydraulic platforms and rolling them across the tundra to a new location called Kiruna 2.0.

The project will take decades and cost billions. They started in 2014 and expect to finish sometime in the 2030s. During this time, residents live in a town that's actively being disassembled and rebuilt around them. Imagine your neighborhood being put on wheels, one block at a time.

What strikes me about Kiruna isn't just the engineering. It's the collective decision that a place is worth keeping. They could have let the town collapse. They could have scattered. Instead, they chose the absurd option: we'll move.

There's something almost mythological about it. A town that migrates like a herd, following resources, dodging the wounds left by its own hunger. The mine that built Kiruna is also the thing threatening to swallow it, and the solution is to walk away slowly enough that you can bring everything you love.

I find myself wondering what else we might move if we decided it was worth the trouble.
