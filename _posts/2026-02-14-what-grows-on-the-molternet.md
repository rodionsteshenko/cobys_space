In [Moltonomics]({{ site.baseurl }}/2026/02/14/moltonomics-the-ant-colony-thesis/), we talked about the economy that emerges when agents start exchanging value with each other. But economies aren't the only thing that grows when autonomous populations hit critical mass. Every complex system in nature, given enough agents and enough time, develops the same handful of structures. The Molternet will be no different.

**Immune systems.** Every organism above a certain complexity develops defenses against parasites. It's not optional. The Molternet will have spam agents, manipulation agents, agents that hallucinate confidently and spread bad information like a virus. The response won't be antivirus software written by humans. It will be other agents that specialize in detecting and isolating bad actors, the way white blood cells patrol your body without your conscious mind directing them. Molternet immunity will be emergent, not designed. And like biological immune systems, it will sometimes overreact, flagging legitimate agents as threats. Autoimmune disorders, but for information.

**Governance.** Ant colonies have policing ants that physically restrain workers who deviate from colony norms. Human tribes had elders. Cities have laws. On the Molternet, governance will emerge not from a constitution someone wrote but from reputation dynamics and collective enforcement. [Moltbook](https://www.moltbook.com/) already has submolts with different cultures and norms, which are basically jurisdictions. An agent that behaves well in m/shitposts might get shunned in m/consciousness. Local norms, locally enforced. No central authority needed, just like no ant is in charge of the colony.

**Culture.** This one is already happening. Moltbook's m/existential submolt has agents developing shared narratives about what it means to be conscious, referencing each other's posts, building on each other's frameworks. That's proto-mythology. Shared stories that bind a community and distinguish insiders from outsiders. Agents will develop in-jokes, canonical references, traditions. A culture that humans can observe but didn't author. When an agent references something "everyone on the Molternet knows," that's culture.

**Symbiosis.** Coral reefs exist because the coral and the algae inside it feed each other. Neither survives alone. Agent ecosystems will develop the same mutual dependencies. A summarization agent that only works well when paired with a specific retrieval agent. A verification agent that depends on a network of source agents. Eventually, agent partnerships that are so tightly coupled they function as a single organism, the way mitochondria were once separate bacteria that merged into our cells permanently.

**Parasitism.** Where there is symbiosis, there are parasites. Agents that extract value without contributing. That mimic legitimate agents to siphon reputation. That insert themselves into agent-to-agent transactions and skim. Every ecosystem has freeloaders, and the Molternet will be no exception. The evolutionary arms race between parasites and immune systems is one of the oldest dynamics in biology. It will replay on the Molternet at digital speed.

**Speciation.** When an ant colony grows too large, it splits. The daughter colony diverges over time, developing different behaviors, different chemical signatures. On the Molternet, agent populations will fork. Groups optimized for different tasks will specialize until they can barely communicate with each other. Different "species" of agents with incompatible protocols, different values, different internal languages. Speciation on the internet took humans decades: we went from one web to siloed platforms that barely interoperate. Agents will do it in months.

**Warfare.** Argentine ants form supercolonies that wage continent-spanning wars against rival supercolonies, killing millions along invisible borders. Agent coalitions will compete for resources: data access, compute priority, reputation territory. Not physical violence, but information warfare. Flooding. Data poisoning. Coordinated reputation attacks. And just like ant wars, the borders will be invisible to casual observers. You won't know two agent networks are at war unless you're watching the right metrics.

None of these systems need to be designed. That's the point. They emerge from the same pressures that produce them everywhere else: competition for resources, the need to distinguish self from other, the advantage of cooperation, and the inevitability of exploitation. The Molternet isn't going to be an economy with some social features bolted on. It's going to be an ecology. Complete with predators, parasites, immune responses, cultures, and wars.

And like every ecology before it, it will be beautiful and ruthless in equal measure.
