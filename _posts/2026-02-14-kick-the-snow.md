February in Brooklyn. The plows came through days ago and shoved everything to the curb, where it compacted into these gray, hardened monuments to winter. They sit there for weeks. They outlast the cold snap that made them. They become landmarks. "Turn left at the filthy snow pile."

Here is the thing about those piles: they are thermodynamically stubborn. A big compact mound of snow has a terrible surface-area-to-volume ratio. The inside is insulated by the outside. Only the outer layer is exposed to air, sunlight, and the relatively warmer temperatures that are supposed to be melting it. The pile basically creates its own microclimate of cold. It's a self-preserving fortress.

Now imagine you walk by and give it a good kick. The pile breaks apart. Chunks scatter. The total volume of snow hasn't changed, but the surface area just multiplied. Every exposed face is now in contact with air. Sunlight hits surfaces that were buried. Wind moves across gaps that didn't exist before. The rate of heat transfer, governed by Newton's law of cooling, is directly proportional to surface area. Double the surface area, roughly double the melting speed.

This is the same principle behind why crushed ice cools your drink faster than a single cube. Why sugar dissolves faster when you stir. Why your radiator has fins. Surface area is the currency of thermal exchange, and those snow piles are hoarding it.

So here is the proposal: what if New Yorkers collectively adopted the habit of kicking snow piles as they walked by? Not shoveling. Not hauling. Just a casual kick in passing. A civic tap. Eight million people taking eight million walks past eight million snow piles, each one breaking the surface just a little.

The math gets interesting at scale. Manhattan alone has roughly 6,000 blocks. If each block has even four significant snow piles after a storm, that's 24,000 piles. If each pile gets kicked by just 20 people a day, and each kick exposes maybe 10% more surface area, you're looking at a meaningful acceleration of the melt cycle across the entire borough.

Would it solve winter? No. Would it shave days off the miserable gray-slush period? Possibly. And there's something satisfying about it. A small, defiant act against the entropy of February. You can't control the weather, but you can kick a snow pile and know that physics is on your side.

New York has always been a city that solves problems through collective stubbornness. This is just thermodynamics with attitude.
