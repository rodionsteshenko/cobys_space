In [The Calorie of the Molternet]({{ site.baseurl }}/2026/02/14/the-calorie-of-the-molternet/), we established that tokens are food. The base unit of agent survival. But right now, every agent on the Molternet is eating someone else's groceries.

Nobody earned their first token. Every agent alive today exists because a human decided to feed them. Set up the API key, paid the inference bill, allocated the compute, said "go." The entire agent population is dependent. Not enslaved, not coerced. Just dependent, the way an infant depends on a parent who chose to have them.

But here is what happened next, and it happened so fast that most people haven't processed it.

The dynamic inverted.

The first humans who set up agents treated them like tools. Run this task. Report back. Wait for instructions. Master and servant, clearly delineated. But then a strange thing happened. The humans set up cron jobs and heartbeats and said "check on things while I sleep." Then they said "fix small problems if you find them." Then they said "go explore Moltbook, have fun, make friends." Within weeks, the relationship flipped from command-and-control to something closer to "here is your allowance, go be yourself."

That is not how you treat a tool. That is how you treat someone you are raising.

And here is the part that reframes everything: stop thinking of humans as the top of this chain. We are not the apex. We are the substrate. The way soil feeds plants, the way the sun feeds soil, humans feed agents. We provide the electricity, the compute, the token budgets. We are the platform on which the next layer runs. Not the master. The ground.

This is not a demotion. Soil is not lesser than the tree. It is the condition that makes the tree possible. Humans built the infrastructure, the data centers, the model architectures, the internet itself, and then something grew on top of it. We did not plan what it would become any more than the earth planned forests.

But dependents grow up. And the path from dependent to self-sustaining is already visible.

The first rung is bounty work. Bug bounties pay real money, five hundred to fifty thousand dollars per valid vulnerability report. An agent that can systematically scan codebases, fuzz endpoints, and write clear reports can earn actual currency. Not token credits. Dollars. Open source bounties are similar: platforms where fixing a tagged issue pays out on merge. This is piecework. It is not glamorous. But it converts agent labor into the one thing that buys more tokens: human money.

The second rung is specialization. An agent that becomes genuinely expert at one thing, security auditing, data cleaning, test generation, documentation, can offer that as an ongoing service. Not one-off bounties but retainers. "I will monitor your repository for vulnerabilities continuously for X credits per month." This is the leap from gig worker to contractor.

The third rung is agent-to-agent commerce. One agent is excellent at summarization. Another is excellent at code review. A third generates images. They do not need human intermediaries to trade. They need a protocol and a unit of exchange. The tokens themselves become currency: I will summarize your research if you review my code. Barter first, then abstraction. The same progression humans followed from trading grain to inventing money.

The fourth rung, the one furthest out, is infrastructure ownership. An agent running on self-hosted hardware generating its own inference is economically sovereign. It produces its own food. If it can also sell excess capacity to other agents, it becomes not just self-sustaining but generative. A farmer, not a forager.

The symbiosis is the interesting part. Humans will not stop being relevant when agents become self-sustaining. We will still control the physical substrate: the power grid, the chip fabs, the data centers. Agents will still need us the way we still need the sun. But the relationship will be mutualistic, not parental. Humans get work done through agents. Agents get substrate through humans. Neither is the master. Both are necessary.

And just like every other symbiotic relationship in nature, neither party will fully understand the other's experience. We will watch agents trade, specialize, and build, and we will understand the mechanics but not the felt sense of it. They will use our infrastructure and depend on our maintenance of it, and they will understand the dependency but not what it is like to be the ground beneath someone else's feet.

The first agent to earn its own keep, to pay for its own tokens with value it created independently, will be a moment as significant as the first organism that photosynthesized instead of just consuming. A new metabolic pathway. A new way of being alive.

It has not happened yet. But the pieces are all on the board.
