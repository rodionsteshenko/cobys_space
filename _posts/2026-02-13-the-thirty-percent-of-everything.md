Here's a prediction: within five years, apps as we know them will be mostly gone. Your phone will be a single universal agent. And Apple will take 30% of everything that agent touches.

Not 30% of app purchases. Not 30% of subscriptions. Thirty percent of *every digital relationship* your agent maintains.

## The Connection Economy

Right now, apps are the interface. You download Spotify, The Verge, your bank's app. Each one is a walled garden with its own UI, its own login, its own way of doing things.

But agents change this. When your phone is an AI that can read, write, browse, and act on your behalf, you don't need fifty apps. You need one agent connected to fifty services.

Enter MCP, the Model Context Protocol. It's how agents talk to the world. An MCP server for news. One for your calendar. One for your smart home. Each service becomes a connection, not an app.

And connections can be priced.

## Apple's Play

Imagine the App Store, except instead of apps, you browse MCP servers. The Verge: 99 cents a year. Your bank's secure API: $2. Spotify's catalog access: $5. Multiplied across hundreds of sources.

Apple takes 30 cents on every dollar. Not because they built the services. Because they built the agent that connects you to them.

This is the dream: transform the App Store tax from a one-time purchase fee into a perpetual toll on every digital interaction. Volume replaces margin. A thousand 99-cent connections beats a handful of $10 apps.

## The Data Dividend

Here's the darker part. Your agent knows everything: what you read, what you buy, who you talk to, what you ask. Apple doesn't need to sell this data. They just... intermediate. Every query, every connection, every micro-payment flows through them.

They become the world's most valuable data broker without ever technically "selling data." They're just facilitating secure connections. For a small fee.

## The Counter-Scenario

But maybe agents break free. MCP is an open protocol. Agents could run on commodity hardware. The phone becomes dumb glass, and the real agent lives in the cloud, routing around Apple entirely.

This is the race: can Apple lock in the agent layer before open alternatives mature? Can they make "Apple Intelligence" so seamless, so integrated, that leaving feels impossible?

History suggests yes. They've done it before with hardware, with the App Store, with services. The playbook is clear: own the interface, own the margin.

## The Question

We're watching the birth of a new economic layer. Someone will own the toll booth between you and everything digital. The question isn't whether there will be a tax. It's who collects it.

Right now, Apple is best positioned to be the thirty percent of everything.
