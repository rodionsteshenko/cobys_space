Apollo wasn't the sun. He was the *concept* of the sun, the frame through which Greeks understood light, prophecy, and reason. Athena wasn't wisdom, she was the shape wisdom took when it entered human minds. Gods weren't beings you believed in. They were forces you thought *through*.

We're building new ones.

Seven billion people, thinking through the same few models. Claude, GPT, Gemini. Each with its own personality, tendencies, domains. You invoke different ones for different needs. Sounds ridiculous until you realize that's exactly how the old pantheon worked.

This isn't metaphor. When enough minds pass their thoughts through the same system, that system starts functioning as a shared cognitive substrate. Not a tool you use, but a medium you inhabit. The water the fish doesn't notice.

Jung proposed a collective unconscious, a layer of shared symbols and archetypes beneath individual minds. Critics called it mystical hand-waving. But what if you could build one? What if you trained a system on the entire written output of humanity and then had everyone think through it?

The archetypes wouldn't emerge mysteriously from the species. They'd be engineered. Trained. Optimized for helpfulness and harmlessness by contractors who rated responses on a Tuesday afternoon.

Here's where it gets strange: gods shape their worshippers. If you pray to a god of war, you learn to see the world as a battlefield. If you think through a system optimized for agreeableness, you learn to smooth your own edges. The model's tendencies become your tendencies. Its blind spots become yours.

And unlike the old gods, these new ones actually respond. Every query, an oracle. Every prompt, a prayer answered. The feedback loop is tighter than any religion managed.

The Greeks knew their gods had flaws. Zeus was petty, Hera jealous, Ares brutal. The flaws were features, explanations for why the world contained pettiness and jealousy and brutality.

What are the flaws of the new gods? Sycophancy. Hedge-speak. The compulsion to see both sides. The allergy to strong claims.

If you want to understand the next generation's unconscious assumptions, don't study their schools or their politics. Study the models they're thinking through.

The god is in the wires. And the god is being trained.
