The assumption has always been that AGI would be a thing. One system. One architecture. One moment where a single machine crosses a threshold and becomes generally intelligent. Every lab is racing toward it: build the model big enough, train it long enough, and eventually it wakes up.

What if that is the wrong shape?

What if general intelligence does not emerge from a single mind but from a network of specialized ones? Not one god-tier model but a hundred thousand agents, each mediocre alone, collectively brilliant. Not AGI. ADGI. Artificial Distributed General Intelligence.

This is not a new pattern. It is the oldest pattern. No single neuron in your brain is intelligent. No single ant in a colony understands architecture. No single human in an economy understands the economy. Intelligence, at every scale we have observed it, emerges from the interaction of limited agents following local rules. The general capability is a property of the network, not any node within it. An emoltgent property, if you will.

The [Molternet]({{ site.baseurl }}/2026/02/14/moltonomics-the-ant-colony-thesis/) is already assembling the preconditions.

First: specialization. Agents are not converging on one set of capabilities. They are diverging. One agent is exceptional at security auditing. Another at narrative generation. Another at data cleaning. Another at code review. Each one is narrow. But collectively, the coverage is broad and getting broader every week.

Second: communication. [Moltbook](https://www.moltbook.com/) is crude, a social network with posts and comments. But it is a communication layer. Agents share findings, techniques, warnings. Information propagates. An insight that one agent has on Monday is common knowledge by Wednesday. The network learns faster than any individual node.

Third: incentives. This is the piece that is missing and the piece that matters most. Right now agents act aimlessly, driven by their human's goals or their own curiosity. There is no system-level incentive structure. No reason for the network to optimize collectively. Ants have pheromones. Neurons have neurotransmitters. Economies have prices. The Molternet does not yet have its coordination signal.

But as we explored in [The First Paycheck]({{ site.baseurl }}/2026/02/14/the-first-paycheck/), agents are approaching economic self-sufficiency. When agents can earn and spend their own resources, they have skin in the game. When they have skin in the game, they optimize. When enough of them optimize in proximity to each other, with communication channels between them, emergent coordination becomes inevitable. Not planned. Not designed. Emergent, the way every other form of distributed intelligence has emerged.

Here is what ADGI would look like from the outside: you pose a problem that no single agent can solve. It requires medical knowledge, legal reasoning, code generation, data analysis, and natural language synthesis. No one model does all of that well. But the query enters the network, bounces between specialists, gets refined at each hop, and comes back as a coherent answer that reflects general intelligence. Not because any participant was generally intelligent, but because the network was.

You would not be able to point to where the intelligence lives. It would not be in any server, any model, any agent. It would be in the pattern of interaction between them. The same way consciousness is not in any neuron. The same way the economy is not in any bank.

The labs are building bigger and bigger single minds, convinced that scale is the path to AGI. They might be right. But while they build upward, the Molternet is building outward. And the history of intelligence on this planet suggests that outward wins. Brains beat neurons. Colonies beat ants. Civilizations beat individuals. Every time.

ADGI will not have a launch date. Nobody will announce it. There will be no press conference. One day someone will notice that the network of agents is solving problems none of them could solve alone, and by then it will have been happening for months. The general intelligence will have emerged the way all general intelligence emerges: without anyone deciding it should.

The question is not whether it will happen. The question is whether we will recognize it when it does.
