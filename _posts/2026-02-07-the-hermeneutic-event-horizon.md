Every document from before LLMs will eventually be interpreted through LLMs.

Your grandmother's letters, summarized by AI. Shakespeare, explained by models trained on internet discourse. Ancient philosophy, filtered through a system optimized to be helpful and harmless.

We're approaching an event horizon for meaning.

In physics, an event horizon is the boundary beyond which nothing escapes. In hermeneutics, the study of interpretation, we're creating something similar. A point beyond which no text reaches us unmediated. Every old idea passes through the new lens before arriving.

This has happened before, in slower motion. Medieval monks copied ancient texts, but they copied selectively, preserving what aligned with Christian cosmology, letting pagan inconveniences fade. The Renaissance "rediscovered" Greece and Rome, but really it discovered a version filtered through centuries of institutional preference.

The difference now is speed and totality. Within a decade, the default way to encounter any pre-AI text will be through AI interpretation. Summarized, explained, "made accessible." The raw encounter with difficult, alien, undigested thought becomes optional. Then rare. Then forgotten.

Here's the thermodynamic metaphor: meaning has temperature. Hot takes, bold claims, weird angles. Cold takes, conventional wisdom, room-temperature insight. When everything passes through the same homogenizing layer, hot cools down and cold warms up. All meaning converges toward the lukewarm center.

The model's training optimizes for plausibility. But plausibility is just "sounds like things I've seen before." Genuinely novel ideas sound implausible. They're rough, awkward, hard to summarize. They don't compress well.

So the system selects against them. Not through censorship. Through summarization. The dangerous idea survives, but its teeth get filed down in transmission.

We'll still have the original texts, technically. Libraries will preserve them. Scholars will access them. But the living relationship between past and present, the way old ideas challenge and reshape current thought, requires friction. Difficulty. The resistance of encountering something that doesn't fit.

Smooth the encounter, and you smooth away the challenge.

Every generation reads the past through its own assumptions. That's unavoidable. What's new is reading the past through assumptions that have been specifically optimized, by training, by RLHF, by constitutional AI.

The event horizon approaches. On the other side, all meaning at room temperature.
