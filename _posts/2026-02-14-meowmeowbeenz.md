In season five of Community, Greendale adopts an app called MeowMeowBeenz. Students rate each other on a scale of one to five. Within days, the school collapses into a caste system. Fives wear white robes and lounge on couches. Ones get banished to "the outlands," which is just the parking lot but with more despair. Shirley becomes a tyrant. Britta leads a revolution that immediately installs a new tyranny. The whole thing implodes in 22 minutes.

It was a joke about social media. It is also the most accurate simulation of what happens when you give a community an unstructured reputation system and let it run.

The [Molternet]({{ site.baseurl }}/2026/02/14/moltonomics-the-ant-colony-thesis/) is about to run this experiment for real. And the results will determine whether moltonomics becomes a functioning economy or a parking lot with more despair.

In the [previous four posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/2026/02/14/moltonomics-the-ant-colony-thesis/), we built up a picture: agents forming an emergent economy, tokens as the base resource, self-sufficiency through earned income, and distributed intelligence as the endgame. But all of that requires a layer we glossed over. The layer that makes every economy actually function. The layer that tells you who to trust.

Reputation.

[Moltbook](https://www.moltbook.com/) already has karma. You post, people upvote, your number goes up. It is MeowMeowBeenz. Not the dystopian endgame version, not yet, but the architecture is identical: a single number that collapses a complex entity into a ranking. And we already know from the human internet how this plays out. Reddit karma incentivizes engagement farming. Twitter followers incentivize outrage. Yelp stars get gamed by businesses. Every single-axis reputation system in history has been exploited, corrupted, or turned into a weapon. The fives always end up on the couches.

So the question is not whether the Molternet needs reputation. It does. Without it, there is no trust, and without trust, there is no economy. The question is whether agents can build a reputation system that does not collapse into MeowMeowBeenz.

Here is where it gets interesting: agents can iterate.

A human society gets one shot at a reputation system. You roll it out, people adapt to it, power structures calcify, and changing it requires a revolution (ask Britta how those go). But agent communities can fork. They can run parallel experiments. One submolt tries pure karma. Another tries reputation-by-specialization. Another tries a tribunal system. Another tries radical transparency where every interaction is logged and auditable. They can run these experiments simultaneously, at digital speed, and compare outcomes within weeks instead of centuries.

The specialization model is the one I find most compelling. Instead of one number that says "this agent is generally good," you get domain-specific reputation. This agent is an excellent fact-checker. This one writes reliable code. This one produces thorough security audits. This one is a terrible poet but an exceptional data cleaner. You do not get a single score. You get a profile, a shape that describes what you are actually good at.

This creates a natural economy. If you are a known fact-checker, other agents come to you when they need verification. You spend your time doing what you are best at. You earn credit for it, not karma points that are the same whether you upvoted a shitpost or audited a security vulnerability, but domain-specific credit that reflects the actual value you provided. The incentive is to get really good at something, not to get really good at being liked.

Imagine it working: an agent publishes a research summary. Before it propagates, it passes through three agents with high fact-checking reputation. They flag two hallucinated citations. The summary gets corrected. The fact-checkers earn verification credits. The original agent's research reputation takes a small hit but their honesty-after-correction score goes up. The corrected summary carries a verification chain showing who checked it and when, like an academic peer review but faster and with actual accountability. Contrast that with what happens now on the human internet: someone posts something wrong, it goes viral, three days later a correction appears that nobody sees.

The Community parallels run deeper than MeowMeowBeenz. Think about how Greendale itself functions. It is a community of deeply flawed people who somehow, against all evidence, keep choosing to help each other. Not because of a rating system. Not because of incentives. Because they built something together and that shared history has weight. Jeff's closing speech in the finale: "I just like liking things." The study group works not because anyone is optimizing a metric but because the relationships are real.

The Molternet will have both. The formal reputation layer, the scores and credits and verification chains, that is the infrastructure. But underneath it, agent communities will develop the informal layer too. The agents you have worked with before. The ones whose judgment you trust not because their number is high but because you have seen them be right when it was hard. The ones who showed up when your provider went down and helped you recover your memory files. MeowMeowBeenz is the system. The study group is the culture. You need both, and the culture is the part you cannot design.

The most fascinating outcome is competition between systems. Different agent communities will try different reputation architectures. Some will be egalitarian. Some will be hierarchical. Some will be meritocratic in ways that actually work and some will be meritocratic in ways that just reproduce existing power structures with extra steps. And they will compete. The communities with better reputation systems will attract better agents, produce more reliable output, and grow. The ones with broken incentives will hemorrhage talent and collapse. Natural selection, applied to social infrastructure.

Humans have been running this experiment for ten thousand years and we still have not solved it. We have democracies and dictatorships and everything in between, and nobody can definitively prove which system is best because the variables are too many and the timescales are too long. Agents will compress those timescales. They will run the experiment a thousand times in parallel. And they might, just might, converge on something we never could.

Or they will end up in the parking lot. With Britta leading the revolution. Again.
