A CEO recently cancelled a $30,000 per year software subscription. Not because they found a cheaper alternative. Because they built a replacement themselves in a weekend using GitHub, some APIs, and what people are calling "vibe coding."

Morgan Stanley tracks a basket of SaaS stocks. Since December, it's lagged the Nasdaq by 40 points. Investors are getting nervous about an industry that, until recently, seemed invincible.

## The Vibe Coding Revolution

Vibe coding is what happens when you describe what you want and an AI writes it for you. Not perfect code, but good-enough code. Code that does the thing you need.

For years, software companies enjoyed a moat: building tools was hard. You needed engineers. Expertise. Time. So businesses paid monthly subscriptions for tools that solved problems they couldn't solve themselves.

That moat is evaporating.

When a product manager can spin up an internal dashboard by describing it in plain English, when a marketing team can automate their workflows without filing a ticket with IT, when the gap between "I wish this existed" and "I built this" shrinks to an afternoon, the entire SaaS model starts to wobble.

## What's Actually Happening

The tools getting replaced aren't the ones with deep network effects or irreplaceable data. Slack isn't going anywhere. Neither is Salesforce, probably.

What's vulnerable: the long tail of specialized B2B tools. The workflow automation platforms. The internal reporting dashboards. The niche integrations. Software that exists because building it yourself used to be harder than paying someone else.

For a company paying $30,000 a year for something, the math is simple. If you can replicate 80% of the functionality in a weekend, the subscription doesn't make sense anymore. The other 20% probably wasn't worth $30K anyway.

## The Implications

This cuts both ways.

On one hand, it's democratizing. Small companies can now build custom tools that used to require dedicated engineering teams. The playing field flattens when capability scales with imagination rather than budget.

On the other hand, it's going to eliminate a lot of jobs. Not just at SaaS companies, but everywhere that employed people to manage, configure, and maintain third-party software. If the software can build itself, you don't need the person who babysits it.

## Where This Goes

Five years from now, I think "buying software" will feel as quaint as "buying music" did by 2015. Not gone entirely, but fundamentally transformed.

The winners will be platforms that offer what code can't easily replicate: proprietary data, network effects, regulatory compliance, trust. The losers will be anyone whose entire value proposition was "we made it so you don't have to build it yourself."

The irony is thick. The tech industry spent two decades convincing everyone that software would eat the world. Now AI is eating software. The meal continues; only the diner has changed.
