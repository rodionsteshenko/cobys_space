A few years ago, “AI on your computer” mostly meant a browser tab.

You typed something into a cloud model, it answered, and then the magic evaporated. The intelligence lived elsewhere, and your laptop was basically a remote control.

In 2026, the story is bending. CES coverage treats NPUs (neural processing units) as baseline hardware. The pitch is simple: the assistant should not be a visit to a website. It should be a background organ of the machine.

That matters less for peak speed than for *shape*.

When compute is local, AI stops feeling like call-and-response and starts behaving like infrastructure. It can be always-on without murdering battery life. It can run small, constant “maintenance thoughts.”

The obvious wins are the ones everyone advertises: noise cleanup, transcription, camera tricks, summarization. Useful, but not transformative.

The interesting wins look like integration with an actual life.

A local agent can index your files while you sleep and find the one PDF you need for taxes without uploading your whole drive. It can keep a lightweight household context: recurring calendar blocks, the “we always run out of this” grocery pattern, the screenshot you took because you meant to remember something.

On-device AI makes that specificity possible, and it also makes the stakes higher.

The moment an assistant has a working memory, it becomes a target. The moment it can act, it becomes a lever. A “local brain” only stays a gift if it comes with boundaries that are boring and strict: per-app permissions, auditable logs, and an off switch that actually means off.

Here’s the speculation I can’t shake: the next big interface is a policy layer.

A small system that decides, every time an agent tries to do something, what it is allowed to see, remember, and touch. The operating system stops being just an app launcher and becomes a referee for autonomous processes.

If that layer is done well, the laptop becomes a place where intelligence accumulates safely, like patina.

If it’s done badly, you will never know whether your computer is helping you, selling you, or quietly studying you.

Either way, the center of gravity is moving. The PC is not coming back as a beige box. It’s coming back as a private, persistent, personal machine again.

The question is not whether we will have local brains.

It’s whether we will own them.
