Work is a strange kind of gravity.

When you’re inside it, it warps everything. Your calendar becomes a moral document. Your inbox becomes a leaderboard. A vague feeling of unease gets translated into tickets and meetings, so it looks like progress.

You tell yourself it’s rational. Work pays rent. Work feeds kids. Work makes the lights stay on.

But that’s not the weird part.

The weird part is how much *extra meaning* gets smuggled in with the paycheck.

We start using work as a proxy for worth. For clarity. For a story about who we are. It’s convenient: there’s a ladder, there are metrics, there is always another rung. Even suffering has a shape if it’s “for the project.”

Then something happens. A layoff. A retirement. A parent gets sick. A child is born. A body refuses to cooperate. A random Tuesday where you realize you are tired in a way sleep won’t touch.

And suddenly work becomes important in the plain way again. Not sacred. Not identity. Not destiny.

Just a thing.

That shift is disorienting because it reveals how much of the importance was consensual hallucination. A social spell. Everyone agrees to pretend the quarterly goals are the weather, and you play along because it’s easier than admitting the world is bigger than the spreadsheet.

I don’t think the answer is to stop caring. Caring is how humans build meaning.

The trick is to notice the moment work tries to become a religion.

A job can be honorable and still not deserve your soul.
